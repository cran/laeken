Changes in laeken version 0.2.2

    + New function 'shrinkOut' for Pareto tail modeling to shrink outliers to 
      the theoretical quantile used for outlier detection.


Changes in laeken version 0.2.1

    + Fixed help files for 'meanExcessPlot' and 'paretoQPlot' on Microsoft 
      Windows systems.
    
    + Fixed package reference in vignette 'laeken-variance'.


Changes in laeken version 0.2

    + Functions for fitting a Pareto distribution now have an additional 
      argument 'x0' to specify threshold directly instead of using number of 
      observations 'k' in the tail.
    
    + In the graphical exploration of the data using 'meanExcessPlot' or 
      'paretoQPlot', sample weights can now be considered and the threshold 
      (scale parameter) can be selected interactively.
    
    + Function 'paretoQPlot' now simply uses logarithmic y-axis to show the 
      labels in the scale of the original values.
    
    + Changed default axis labels in 'paretoQPlot'.
    
    + Sample weights can now be considered when fitting a Pareto distribution 
      using 'thetaHill', 'thetaISE' or 'thetaPDC'.
    
    + New function 'calibVars' for convenient construction of binary variables 
      for calibration.
    
    + New functions 'paretoTail', 'replaceTail', 'replaceOut' and 'reweightOut' 
      for improved methodology for Pareto tail modeling with a common interface.
    
    + Row names of the example data 'eusilc' are now given by 1 to the number 
      of rows.
    
    + New wrapper function 'weightedMean' for the (weighted) mean.
    
    + New function 'paretoScale' for estimating the threshold for Pareto tail 
      modeling.
    
    + Totals for calibrated bootstrap variance are now by default computed from 
      the original data using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.
    
    + Added package vignettes 'laeken-standard', 'laeken-pareto' and 
      'laeken-variance'.



Changes in laeken version 0.1.3

    + Minimal changes in help file for 'calibWeights'.


Changes in laeken version 0.1.2

    + Bugfix in 'thetaWML' for bias correction term with weight function based 
      on standardized residuals.


Changes in laeken version 0.1.1

    + Bugfix in 'bootVar' in case of breakdown by year and stratum.
