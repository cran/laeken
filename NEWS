Changes in laeken version 0.2

    + Functions for fitting a Pareto distribution now have an additional 
      argument 'x0' to specify threshold directly instead of using number of 
      observations 'k' in the tail.
    
    + In the graphical exploration of the data using 'meanExcessPlot' or 
      'paretoQPlot', sample weights can now be considered and the threshold 
      (scale parameter) can be selected interactively.
    
    + Function 'paretoQPlot' now simply uses logarithmic y-axis to show the 
      labels in the scale of the original values.
    
    + Changed default axis labels in 'paretoQPlot'.
    
    + Sample weights can now be considered when fitting a Pareto distribution 
      using 'thetaHill', 'thetaISE' or 'thetaPDC'.
    
    + New function 'calibVars' for convenient construction of binary variables 
      for calibration.
    
    + New functions 'paretoTail', 'replaceTail', 'replaceOut' and 'calibOut' 
      for improved methodology for Pareto tail modeling with a common interface.
    
    + Row names of the example data 'eusilc' are now given by 1 to the number 
      of rows.
    
    + New wrapper function 'weightedMean' for the (weighted) mean.
    
    + New function 'paretoScale' for estimating the threshold for Pareto tail 
      modeling.
    
    + Totals for calibrated bootstrap variance are now by default computed from 
      the original data using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.
    
    + Added package vignettes 'laeken-standard', 'laeken-pareto' and 
      'laeken-variance'.

      on standardized residuals.


Changes in laeken version 0.1.1

    + Bugfix in 'bootVar' in case of breakdown by year and stratum.
